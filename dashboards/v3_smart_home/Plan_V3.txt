Plan Specific Complex Dashboard
Subtask:
Define the specific complex dashboard to be developed. This includes:

Identifying a suitable dataset from the provided folders that supports the required elements (multiple complex diagrams, predictive analysis, maps, storytelling).
Outlining the narrative or "story" the dashboard will tell through the data.
Specifying the types of complex charts and diagrams to be included (at least 3).
Defining the predictive analysis task and how its results will be visualized.
Planning the integration of map visualizations.
Detailing the required interactivity and filters for this specific dashboard.
Reasoning: To plan the specific complex dashboard, I need to select a suitable dataset from the provided Google Drive folders ("Python Visualization V2" and "AI ST"). This dataset must ideally contain:

Hierarchical or multi-categorical data for complex diagrams (like sunburst, treemap, or nested bar charts).
Numerical data that can be used for predictive analysis.
Geographical data (like city, state, country, or coordinates) for map visualizations.
Data that lends itself to a narrative or "story".
I will review the file contents I previously read, focusing on datasets mentioned or included in files like "Data Visualization & Dashboards Dash App Examples 1.pdf", "Predictive Analytics Dash App Examples 2.pdf", the python_viz_guide files, and any data files (.csv, .txt) listed in the "AI ST" folder.

Based on the available data and the requirement for complex diagrams, predictive analysis, and maps, I will then define:

The chosen dataset.
The story the dashboard will tell.
At least three complex chart types.
The predictive analysis task and its visualization.
How map visualizations will be integrated.
The required filters and interactivity.

Prepare Data for Complex Dashboard
Subtask:
Process and prepare the selected dataset for the specific complex dashboard, including any necessary feature engineering for predictive analysis and formatting for the chosen visualization types (e.g., geographical data for maps).

Reasoning: Based on the plan for the complex dashboard, we need a dataset (either real from the provided folders or simulated) that includes hierarchical data, numerical values for predictive analysis, and geographical information. This step involves creating or loading this dataset and ensuring it's in a format suitable for generating the planned charts (sunburst/treemap, scatter plot, map) and for training a predictive model. Since a specific, readily available dataset with all these components wasn't confirmed from the file analysis, we will simulate a dataset that fits the described structure and characteristics for demonstration purposes.

# For this preparatory step, we will keep the data simple and directly use

# Data formatting for visualizations:
# - Hierarchical data is already in a suitable format for sunburst/treemap (multiple columns).

Develop Complex Dashboard Code (Iterative)
Subtask:
Using the generic template as a foundation (where applicable) and following the guidelines, write the Python/Dash code for the specific complex dashboard. Implement the planned charts, predictive analysis visualization, map integration, and interactivity. This will be an iterative process, refining each component.

Reasoning: This is the core implementation step for the complex dashboard. We will start by setting up the basic Dash application structure, potentially leveraging the concepts from the generic template (although the template code itself hasn't been explicitly written yet, the principles from the planning stages will be applied). We will then add the planned visualizations one by one, integrate the predictive analysis component and its visualization, include the map, and build the necessary callback functions for interactivity and filtering. This will require multiple iterations and refinements to ensure all components work together effectively and adhere to the project guidelines.

# Develop Complex Dashboard Code (Iterative) - Integrate Predictive Analysis

from dash import Dash, dcc, html
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.colors
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # Import necessary ML libraries

Reasoning: Continuing with the "Develop Complex Dashboard Code (Iterative)" step, the next focus is to integrate the predictive analysis component and its visualization into the dashboard. This will involve:

Defining and training a simple predictive model using the prepared data (df_complex). For this example, we'll train a basic linear regression model to predict 'Annual_Energy_Savings' based on other features.
Visualizing the results of the predictive analysis. A simple approach is to visualize the model's predictions against the actual values or to show the importance of different features in the prediction. We will visualize feature importance using a bar chart.
Integrating this visualization into the Dash layout and callback to ensure it updates based on filters (though the model itself will be trained on the full dataset for simplicity in this preparatory step).
